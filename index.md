# About
The 14th International Workshop on Scheduling and Resource Management for Parallel and Distributed Systems will be held at University of Oregon on 13 August, in conjunction with the [ICPP'18](http://www.icpp-conf.org) - 2018 International Conference on Parallel Processing.
Resource management and scheduling is a crucial task on large-scale computing systems. It plays an essential role in the optimization of resources usage. The goal of this workshop is to bring together researchers and practitioners working in the areas of resource scheduling and resource management to exchange and share their experiences, new ideas, and latest research results on all aspects of scheduling and resource management in parallel and distributed systems including Grids and Clouds.

# List of Topics
* Resource allocation and management
* Advance resource reservation and scheduling
* Load sharing and Load balancing techniques
* Network resource allocation
* Fault-tolerant resource management approaches
* Data access and management
* Scheduling data intensive jobs
* Scheduling on heterogeneous nodes
* Time slicing, gang, or co-scheduling
* Fairness, priorities, and accounting Issues
* Performance implications of scheduling strategies
* Performance metrics to compare scheduling schemes
* Virtualization of resources
* Energy-Aware Resource Management and Scheduling
