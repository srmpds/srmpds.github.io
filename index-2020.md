# About
The ___16th___ International Workshop on Scheduling and Resource Management for Parallel and Distributed Systems will be held in Edmonton, AB, Canada, in conjunction with the [ICPP'20](https://jnamaral.github.io/icpp20/) - 2020 International Conference on Parallel Processing.

Resource management and scheduling is a crucial task on large-scale computing systems. It plays an essential role in the optimization of resources usage. The goal of this workshop is to bring together researchers and practitioners working in the areas of resource scheduling and resource management to exchange and share their experiences, new ideas, and latest research results on all aspects of scheduling and resource management in parallel and distributed systems including Grids and Clouds.

# Program
Events will be held on August 17th virtually. All time is **UTC!!!**. 

The keynote will be **live** presentation. After the keynote, each paper will have 5 minutes to briefly introduce their work([Compiled Slides](./doc/pitch-slides.pdf)). We assume that our audience has watched the full presentation recording before the workshop. We start Q & A for all papers, after all 5-minutes teaser talk.
