Call For Paper || The 14th SRMPDS ||  Eugene, OR, United States, August 13-16, 2018

SCOPE
==================
The 14th International Workshop on Scheduling and Resource Management for Parallel and Distributed Systems (SRMPDS'18) will be held in conjunction with the ICPP'18 - 47th International Conference on Parallel Processing in Eugene, OR, United States, August 13-16, 2018.
Resource management and scheduling is a crucial task on large-scale computing systems. It plays an essential role in the optimization of resources usage. The goal of this workshop is to bring together researchers and practitioners working in the areas of resource scheduling and resource management to exchange and share their experiences, new ideas, and latest research results on all aspects of scheduling and resource management in parallel and distributed systems including Grids and Clouds.

SUBMISSIONS
==================
Papers should not exceed 10 pages in the ACM format located at: https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template
Papers should be submitted via https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=srmpds2018 
All accepted papers will be available at the conference in ICPP’18 proceedings, and will be submitted to the IEEE Xplore and CSDL for EI indexing. After the workshop, the extended version of top few papers will be invited to publish on the Journal of Cluster Computing (2016 Impact Factor: 2.04, 5-Year Impact Factor: 2.08, Quartile: Q2).
